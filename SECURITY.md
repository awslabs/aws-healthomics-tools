# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.13.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.13  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainers at [security contact - to be filled by maintainers]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

## Security Measures

This project implements the following security measures:

### Comprehensive Security Automation
- **Multi-layered Dependency Scanning**: Dependabot + pip-audit for comprehensive coverage
- **Static Code Analysis**: CodeQL performs deep security vulnerability analysis
- **CI/CD Integration**: Security scans on every PR with fail-fast on vulnerabilities
- **Automated Remediation**: Dependabot creates PRs for security updates automatically
- **GitHub Security Integration**: SARIF reporting to centralized Security dashboard
- **Scheduled Monitoring**: Weekly automated scans catch new vulnerabilities
- **Proactive Prevention**: Catches vulnerabilities before they reach production

### Advanced Security Features
- **SARIF Integration**: Industry-standard security reporting format
- **Vulnerability Prioritization**: Security updates labeled and prioritized
- **Automated Testing**: Security fixes validated through CI pipeline
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both direct and transitive dependency scanning

### Dependency Management
- Dependencies are regularly updated
- Security patches are prioritized
- Minimal dependency footprint maintained

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project:

1. Keep dependencies up to date
2. Use secure coding practices
3. Validate all inputs
4. Follow the principle of least privilege
5. Report security concerns promptly

## Why Comprehensive Security Automation?

While basic dependency updates (like Dependabot PRs) address individual vulnerabilities,
comprehensive security automation provides:

- **Proactive Detection**: Catches vulnerabilities immediately when disclosed
- **Automated Validation**: Security fixes are tested through CI pipeline
- **Centralized Management**: All security issues tracked in GitHub Security dashboard
- **Prevention Focus**: Stops vulnerable code from reaching production
- **Complete Coverage**: Scans code, dependencies, and build processes

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- **Automatically detected** through continuous scanning
- **Immediately flagged** in pull requests and builds
- **Rapidly deployed** through automated dependency updates
- **Thoroughly tested** via integrated CI/CD security checks
- **Centrally tracked** through GitHub Security Advisories
- **Proactively monitored** through scheduled security scans
